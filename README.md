## Understanding Claude Code: Beyond the Basics

### What Makes Claude Code Different

Claude Code represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI coding assistants. While tools like GitHub Copilot focus on code completion, Claude Code operates as an **agentic system** capable of understanding entire project contexts, making architectural decisions, and executing complex multi-step workflows.

**Traditional AI Tools vs Claude Code:**

| Traditional Tools | Claude Code |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Line-by-line completion | Full project understanding |
| Single-file context | Cross-file analysis |
| Reactive suggestions | Proactive planning |
| Manual integration | Autonomous execution |
| Pattern matching | Reasoning and adaptation |

### Core Architecture Philosophy

Claude Code is built on three fundamental principles:

**1. Low-Level Control**
Unlike opinionated frameworks, Claude Code gives you direct access to Claude's reasoning without forcing specific workflows. This means you can adapt it to any development methodology, team structure, or project architecture.

**2. Context-Aware Intelligence**
The system builds and maintains a comprehensive understanding of your project through multiple data sources:
- File system structure and patterns
- Git history and branching strategies
- Documentation and configuration files
- Team conventions and coding standards
- Previous interactions and learned patterns

**3. Agentic Behavior**
Rather than just responding to prompts, Claude Code can:
- Plan complex multi-step operations
- Make decisions based on project context
- Execute tasks autonomously
- Learn and adapt to your patterns
- Provide reasoning for its decisions

### Installation & First Steps

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 16+ or access to Anthropic's distribution
- Git configured with your credentials
- Terminal with Unicode support
- Code editor with extension support

**Installation Process:**
```bash
# Method 1: NPM (Official & Recommended)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Method 2: Homebrew (macOS & Linux)
brew install anthropic/tap/claude-code

# Method 3: Arch Linux AUR
yay -S claude-code        # or paru -S claude-code

# Method 4: Docker (containerized)
docker pull ghcr.io/rchgrav/claudebox:latest

# Method 5: Windows via WSL (Anthropic-recommended)
# Enable WSL 2, install Ubuntu, then:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version
claude /doctor
```

**Critical First Steps:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize Claude Code (ESSENTIAL)
claude
/init

# This creates CLAUDE.md - the most important file
# Without this, you're only using 20% of Claude Code's potential
```

### Pricing Strategy for Power Users

**The Economics of the Max Plan ($100/month):**

The Max Plan becomes cost-effective when you consider:
- **Token costs**: Heavy API usage can easily exceed $500-1000/month
- **Time savings**: 2 hours saved monthly = $100+ value for most developers
- **Workflow continuity**: No interruptions from rate limits or token counting
- **Feature access**: Extended thinking, unlimited context, advanced reasoning

**Real-world cost comparison:**
```
Scenario: Senior developer using Claude Code 4 hours/day

API Pricing (Pay-per-use):
- 50k tokens/hour √ó 4 hours √ó 22 days = 4.4M tokens/month
- At $15/1M tokens = $66/month (basic usage)
- With extended thinking + context: $200-400/month

Max Plan: $100/month flat
Break-even: ~1.5 hours of development time saved monthly
```

## Mastering the CLAUDE.md File

### Why CLAUDE.md is Critical

The CLAUDE.md file is Claude Code's memory system. Without it, Claude starts fresh with each interaction, unable to learn your team's patterns, coding standards, or project-specific knowledge. **This is the #1 factor that separates novice users from power users.**

### Comprehensive CLAUDE.md Structure

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - Project Intelligence File

## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript application for project management with a Node.js backend.
We follow Domain-Driven Design principles and use a microservices architecture.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript 5.2, Vite, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL 15
- Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS

## Commands & Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server (frontend on :3000, backend on :3001)
- `npm run build`: Production build with optimization
- `npm run typecheck`: Full TypeScript validation
- `npm test`: Run unit tests with coverage
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright end-to-end tests
- `npm run db:migrate`: Apply database migrations
- `npm run db:seed`: Seed development data

## Code Style & Standards
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow compound component patterns for complex UI
- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for formatting
- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Architecture Patterns
- Feature-based folder structure (not type-based)
- Barrel exports from index.ts files
- Custom hooks pattern: useFeatureName
- API layer: services/api/featureName.ts
- State management: Zustand for global state, React state for local
- Error boundaries for component error handling

## Testing Philosophy
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Focus on user behavior, not implementation details
- Use data-testid for element selection
- Mock external dependencies, test integration at boundaries
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

## Database Patterns
- Use Prisma schema-first approach
- Soft deletes with deletedAt timestamps
- UUID primary keys for public-facing entities
- Created/updated timestamp tracking
- Database migrations in version control

## Security Considerations
- All API endpoints require authentication except /health
- Use helmet.js for security headers
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- CORS configured for production domains only

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Environment-specific configs in .env files
- Docker multi-stage builds for optimization
- Kubernetes manifests in k8s/ directory
- Secrets managed through AWS Secrets Manager

## Team Conventions
- Feature branch workflow with PR reviews
- Squash commits before merging
- Deploy to staging automatically on main branch
- Production deploys require manual approval
- Breaking changes require RFC discussion

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't use any dependencies in database migrations
- Avoid defaultProps in TypeScript components (use default parameters)
- Don't commit .env files (use .env.example instead)
- Always handle loading and error states in components
- Don't use any or unknown types without good reason

## Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load route components
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Debounce search inputs and API calls
- Optimize bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Use CDN for static assets

## Debugging & Development
- Use React DevTools and Redux DevTools
- Enable source maps in development
- Use VS Code debugger with launch.json configuration
- Log structured data for easier parsing
- Use error tracking (Sentry) in production

## External Dependencies
- Avoid adding new dependencies without team discussion
- Prefer utilities from lodash over custom implementations
- Use date-fns instead of moment.js (bundle size)
- UI components from our custom design system only

## Documentation Standards
- All public functions must have JSDoc comments
- README files for each major feature
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major decisions
```

### Dynamic CLAUDE.md Patterns

**Adding learned patterns with `#` command:**
```bash
# During development, when Claude learns something useful:
You: "Great! This pattern worked well for our error handling."
Claude: "I'll add this to your CLAUDE.md file for future reference."
# Press # to automatically append the pattern
```

**Version-controlled CLAUDE.md:**
```bash
# Track CLAUDE.md evolution with your codebase
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: update error handling patterns in CLAUDE.md"
```

---

## Advanced Context Management

### Understanding Context Boundaries

Claude Code maintains several types of context:

**1. Session Context**
- Current conversation history
- File modifications in progress
- Temporary variables and state

**2. Project Context**
- CLAUDE.md file contents
- Project structure and dependencies
- Git history and branch information

**3. Global Context**
- User preferences and patterns
- Cross-project learnings (when enabled)
- Tool configurations

### Strategic Context Clearing

```bash
# Clear everything (nuclear option)
/clear

# Clear only conversation history (keep project context)
/clear --conversation-only

# Clear and restart with fresh project scan
/clear --rescan-project

# Selective context clearing
/clear --except=claude.md,git-history
```

### Context Optimization Strategies

**For Large Codebases (>10k files):**
```bash
# Use scope limiting
claude --scope="src/components,src/hooks" "refactor authentication logic"

# Exclude irrelevant directories
claude --exclude="node_modules,dist,build,coverage" "analyze code structure"

# Focus on specific file types
claude --include="*.ts,*.tsx" --exclude="*.test.*" "add type safety"
```

**For Complex Features:**
```markdown
# Create context anchoring documents
## current-task.md
Working on: User authentication refactor
Status: Planning phase
Key files: src/auth/, src/components/Login.tsx
Dependencies: @auth0/auth0-react
Next steps: 
1. Plan component structure
2. Update routing
3. Add tests
```

### Multi-Context Development

**Running multiple Claude instances:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend development
cd frontend && claude
> "Focus on React components and styling"

# Terminal 2: Backend development
cd backend && claude  
> "Handle API endpoints and database queries"

# Terminal 3: Testing and QA
cd . && claude --scope="tests,cypress"
> "Write and execute tests for current features"

# Terminal 4: DevOps and deployment
cd infrastructure && claude
> "Manage deployment scripts and configurations"
```

## Power User Features & Techniques

### Extended Thinking Mode

**Triggering Deep Analysis:**
```bash
# Basic extended thinking
claude "think about the best architecture for our microservices communication"

# Enhanced reasoning
claude "think hard about the security implications of our authentication flow"

# Maximum analysis
claude "ultrathink the scalability challenges and provide a comprehensive solution"
```

**When to Use Each Level:**
- **think**: Complex architectural decisions, code design patterns
- **think hard**: Security analysis, performance optimization, complex debugging
- **ultrathink**: System-wide refactoring, critical business logic, high-stakes decisions

**Dev Container "Yolo Mode":**

When working in development containers or isolated environments, you can enable aggressive automation:

```bash
# In development containers only - bypasses all permission prompts
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Combined with environment optimization for containers
export CLAUDE_CODE_CONTAINER_MODE=1
export BYPASS_ALL_CONFIRMATIONS=1

# Use with caution - only in isolated, disposable environments
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -e CLAUDE_CODE_CONTAINER_MODE=1 \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  claude-dev-container \
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "refactor entire codebase"
```

### Subagent Workflows

```bash
# Using subagents for complex validation
claude "
Implement a distributed caching system and use subagents to:
- Verify the performance characteristics
- Validate security implications  
- Check for potential race conditions
- Analyze memory usage patterns
- Review error handling completeness
"
```

### Visual Development Workflow

```bash
# Screenshot-driven development
claude "
1. Take a screenshot of the current login page
2. Here's the new design mockup: [paste image]
3. Implement the new design with:
   - Responsive behavior
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Smooth animations
   - Error state handling
4. Take screenshots of the implementation
5. Iterate until it matches the design exactly
"
```

### Advanced Prompting Patterns

**Structured Problem Solving:**
```bash
claude "
CONTEXT: E-commerce platform with 1M+ users, React frontend, microservices backend
CONSTRAINTS: Must maintain 99.9% uptime, PCI compliance required, $50k monthly AWS budget
GOAL: Reduce page load time by 40% while improving conversion rates
FORMAT: Provide analysis, implementation plan, and success metrics
EXAMPLES: Similar optimizations you've seen work (CDN, code splitting, caching)
VALIDATION: How we'll measure success and rollback if needed

Analyze our performance bottlenecks and create an optimization strategy.
"
```

## Custom Commands & Slash Commands

### Understanding Custom Slash Commands

Custom slash commands are Claude Code's most powerful feature for creating reusable, team-specific workflows. Unlike built-in commands, custom commands let you encode your team's processes, tools, and expertise into repeatable automation.

### Creating Custom Commands

**Command Structure:**
```bash
# Commands are stored in .claude/commands/
mkdir -p .claude/commands/

# Create a command file: command-name.md
touch .claude/commands/security-audit.md
```

**Basic Command Template:**
```markdown
# Security Audit Command

Perform a comprehensive security audit of the current codebase:

## Authentication & Authorization
- Review JWT implementation for vulnerabilities
- Check for proper session management  
- Validate RBAC implementation

## Input Validation
- Scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Check XSS prevention measures
- Validate API input sanitization

## Output Format
Provide a prioritized list of findings with:
- Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Description of the vulnerability
- Potential impact
- Recommended remediation
- Code examples where applicable

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (specific areas to focus on)
```

**Using Custom Commands:**
```bash
# Execute custom commands
/security-audit api authentication
/security-audit frontend xss-prevention

# List available custom commands
/commands
```

### Repository Commands

**The commands/ directory in this guide's repository includes:**

**1. `gemini-analyze.md`** - Leverage Google Gemini's 2M token context window for massive codebase analysis
**2. `ast-grep.md`** - Structural code analysis and pattern matching using AST-Grep
**3. `security-scan.md`** - Comprehensive security audit workflows
**4. `performance-audit.md`** - Performance analysis and optimization
**5. `architecture-review.md`** - System architecture evaluation
**6. `tech-debt.md`** - Technical debt assessment and prioritization

### Built-in Slash Commands (Reference)

While the focus is on custom commands, here are key built-in commands:

**Essential Commands:**
```bash
/init                    # Create CLAUDE.md file
/clear                   # Clear conversation context
/help                    # Show available commands
/permissions             # Manage tool permissions
/memory                  # Edit project memory
/doctor                  # System health check
/config                  # Configuration management
/mcp                     # MCP server management
```

## Integration Patterns & MCP Servers

### Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP servers extend Claude Code's capabilities by providing access to external systems and data sources. Think of them as specialized plugins that give Claude direct access to your development ecosystem.

### Essential MCP Server Configurations

**Database Integration:**
```json5
// .mcp.json (project-level) or ~/.claude.json (global)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp",
        "ALLOWED_OPERATIONS": ["SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"],
        "SCHEMA_ACCESS": ["public", "analytics"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Development Tools:**
```json5
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace", "/docs"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS": [".js", ".ts", ".json", ".md", ".py"],
        "BLOCKED_PATHS": [".env", "node_modules", ".git", "*.key"]
      }
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Documentation & Context:**
```json5
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CACHE_DOCS": "true",
        "AUTO_UPDATE": "daily"
      }
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your_brave_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Server Management

**Essential MCP commands:**
```bash
# Interactive MCP setup
claude mcp

# List configured servers
claude mcp list

# Add new server
claude mcp add postgres "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"

# Remove server
claude mcp remove postgres

# Restart all servers
claude mcp restart --all

# Debug MCP issues
claude --mcp-debug
```

### MCP Server Usage Patterns

**Database-Driven Development:**
```bash
claude "
Using the database MCP server:

1. Analyze our user table structure
2. Identify performance bottlenecks in the most common queries
3. Suggest and implement database optimizations
4. Update the corresponding TypeScript interfaces
5. Write migration scripts for any schema changes
"
```

**Documentation-Driven Development:**
```bash
claude "
Use Context7 to fetch the latest React 18 patterns and:
1. Audit our components for outdated patterns
2. Identify opportunities to use new React features
3. Refactor our most complex components
4. Update our coding standards documentation
"
```

---

## Hooks & Automation

### Git Hooks Integration

Claude Code can be integrated into your Git workflow through hooks, enabling automated code analysis, security scanning, and quality checks at critical points in your development process.

### Pre-commit Hooks

**Basic pre-commit security scan:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Get staged files
staged_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM)

if [ -z "$staged_files" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

echo "üîç Running Claude Code security scan..."

# Analyze staged changes
analysis=$(echo "$staged_files" | xargs cat | \
    claude -p "Review these staged changes for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality problems. Focus on: SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, and performance anti-patterns." \
    --allowedTools "View" \
    --output-format json)

# Check for critical issues
if echo "$analysis" | jq -e '.severity == "critical"' > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå Critical security issues found - commit blocked"
    echo "$analysis" | jq -r '.findings[]'
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Security scan passed"
```

### Advanced Hook Use Cases

#### Task Completion Reporting

**Automated task summaries after each session:**
```json5
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Task completed at $(date). Summary: Claude Code has finished processing.' | tee -a ~/claude_task_log.txt"
          }
        ]
      }

```

#### Mobile Notification System

**Real-time alerts for critical operations:**
```json5
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/scripts/ping_mobile.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Mobile notification script with multiple services:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/scripts/ping_mobile.sh

TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$1" | jq -r '.tool_name // "unknown tool"')
MESSAGE="Claude Code needs attention: $TOOL_NAME"

# Option 1: Pushover
curl -s -X POST "https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json" \

## Performance Optimization & Scaling

### Managing Large Codebases

**Strategies for 100k+ line codebases:**

```bash
# Hierarchical context management
claude --scope="src/core" "
Analyze the core business logic layer and identify:
- Circular dependencies
- Violation of clean architecture principles
- Opportunities for better separation of concerns
"

# Incremental analysis
claude "
Perform incremental codebase analysis:
1. Start with package.json and understand dependencies
2. Analyze top-level directory structure  
3. Focus on src/components and identify patterns
4. Deep dive into identified problem areas
5. Provide refactoring recommendations
"
```

**Memory and Performance Optimization:**
```bash
# Context window management
claude --max-context=50000 "
Focus analysis on critical path performance:
- Database query optimization
- Frontend bundle size reduction
- API response time improvements
Skip non-critical files and focus on user-facing performance.
"
```

### Parallel Development Workflows

**Git Worktree Integration:**
```bash
# Setup multiple working directories
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/authentication
git worktree add ../feature-ui feature/ui-redesign
git worktree add ../hotfix-security hotfix/security-patch

# Run Claude in each worktree
cd ../feature-auth && claude "Implement OAuth2 flow"
cd ../feature-ui && claude "Redesign dashboard components"  
cd ../hotfix-security && claude "Fix XSS vulnerability in user input"
```

**Team Collaboration Patterns:**
```bash
# Shared context files
# .claude/team-context.md
```
```markdown
## Current Sprint Goals
- Implement user dashboard redesign
- Optimize database query performance  
- Add comprehensive error handling

## Team Member Focuses
- @alice: Frontend components and styling
- @bob: Backend API optimization
- @charlie: Testing and QA automation

## Shared Conventions
- All new components must be TypeScript strict
- Database queries require performance testing
- UI changes need accessibility review
```

### Automated Code Quality

**Performance Monitoring Integration:**
```bash
claude "
Set up automated performance monitoring:

1. Add lighthouse CI to our build process
2. Create performance budgets for bundle size
3. Set up Core Web Vitals tracking
4. Add database query performance monitoring
5. Create alerts for performance regressions

Generate configuration files and update our CI/CD pipeline.
"
```

## Security & Best Practices

### Secure Development Workflows

**Security-First Development:**
```bash
claude "
Implement a new user registration feature with security-first approach:

THREAT MODELING:
- Identify potential attack vectors
- Analyze data flow for sensitive information
- Consider OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

SECURE IMPLEMENTATION:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Email verification with secure tokens
- Audit logging for security events

TESTING:
- Security unit tests
- Integration tests for auth flows
- Penetration testing scenarios

DOCUMENTATION:
- Security architecture decisions
- Incident response procedures
- Security review checklist
"
```

### Permission Management

**Granular Permission Controls:**
```json5
// .claude/permissions.json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Edit:src/**",
    "Edit:tests/**", 
    "Bash:npm run *",
    "Bash:git add *, git commit *, git push *",
    "WebFetch:docs.* api.*"
  ],
  "blockedTools": [
    "Bash:rm -rf *",
    "Bash:sudo *",
    "Edit:**/.env",
    "Edit:**/*key*"
  ],
  "confirmationRequired": [
    "Bash:git push origin main",
    "Edit:package.json",
    "Edit:docker-compose.yml"
  ]
}
```

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
```bash
# Configure data protection patterns
claude "
Review our codebase for sensitive data exposure:

1. Scan for hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords
2. Identify PII (personally identifiable information) handling
3. Check for proper encryption of sensitive data
4. Verify secure logging practices (no sensitive data in logs)
5. Audit environment variable usage
6. Check for proper CORS and CSP headers

Generate a security audit report with remediation steps.

## Troubleshooting & Advanced Debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Context Window Overflow:**
```bash
# Problem: "Context window exceeded" errors
# Solution: Strategic context management

claude --clear-context "
Let's start fresh and focus specifically on:
- The authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts
- Related test files only
- Ignore everything else for now
"
```

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: Slow response times
# Solution: Optimize context and scope

# Before (slow)
claude "Analyze the entire codebase for bugs"

# After (fast)
claude --scope="src/components/Login" "Debug the login form validation issue"
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: High memory usage
# Solution: Incremental processing

claude "
Process our migration to TypeScript incrementally:
1. Convert 5 files at a time
2. Test after each batch
3. Commit working changes
4. Continue with next batch
5. Report progress after each iteration
"
```

### Advanced Debugging Techniques

**Multi-Layer Debugging:**
```bash
claude "
Debug this complex issue using multiple approaches:

STATIC ANALYSIS:
- Code review for logic errors
- Type checking and linting
- Dependency analysis

DYNAMIC ANALYSIS:  
- Add debugging statements
- Create reproduction test cases
- Use browser dev tools integration

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
- Check network requests
- Analyze database queries
- Review server logs

Provide findings at each layer and root cause analysis.
"
```

### Error Recovery Patterns

**Automated Rollback:**
```bash
claude "
If this database migration fails:
1. Automatically create rollback script
2. Restore from backup if needed
3. Notify team via Slack
4. Create incident report
5. Update runbook with lessons learned

Implement with proper error handling and recovery procedures.
"
```

# Project-specific configurations
# project-a/.claude/config.json
{
  "inherits": "../shared/.claude/base-config.json",
  "project": {
    "name": "Frontend Application",
    "conventions": "React + TypeScript",
    "testing": "Jest + React Testing Library"
  }
}

# project-b/.claude/config.json  
{
  "inherits": "../shared/.claude/base-config.json",
  "project": {
    "name": "Backend API",
    "conventions": "Node.js + Express",
    "testing": "Jest + Supertest"
  }
}
```

### Knowledge Management

**Organizational Learning:**
```bash
claude "
Create a knowledge management system for our development practices:

1. Extract patterns from successful projects
2. Document common debugging approaches
3. Create reusable templates for new features
4. Build a decision tree for architecture choices
5. Maintain a FAQ for common issues

Update our CLAUDE.md files across all projects with shared learnings.

## Tips and Tricks

### Audio Notifications for Task Completion

**Claude Code tip for Mac users:**

Add this to your CLAUDE.md file for hands-free productivity:

```markdown
## Audio Notifications
Whenever you're done with a task or need my attention to approve something, run one of the following commands on the terminal, based on the event type:

`say "Task completed successfully"`
`say "I need your confirmation"`  
`say "Ready for review" --voice=Samantha`
`say "Error encountered - check output" --rate=150`

# Integration with system notifications
`osascript -e 'display notification "Claude task finished" with title "Development Update"'`
```

This simple trick transforms your development workflow by providing audio alerts when Claude completes long-running tasks, allowing you to:
- Work on other tasks while Claude processes complex requests
- Get notified immediately when manual approval is needed
- Avoid constantly checking the terminal for completion status
- Maintain focus while Claude handles background work

**Why this works so well:**
- Mac's built-in `say` command provides clear, immediate feedback
- Works even when your terminal is in the background
- No additional dependencies or setup required
- Can be customized with different phrases or voices

Thank me later! :)
